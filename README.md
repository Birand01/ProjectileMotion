# ProjectileMotion

There are three options shown on the screen as a UI element. Every individual uÄ± element supports different option.
Their features are listed below,

Height(slider): It mainly changes the height of the line renderer. In this way,increasing height of the line renderer also increases the falling time of the ball and this results in rate of change of the velocity. If we incease height of projectile motion, ball is going to move slower ad vice versa.

Set Base Position(Button): It sets the initial base position of the ball. As you can see from the scene, we have a blue cubic ground and we can change its position on the scene
via using mouse. You can hold this ground with mouse and move it with respect to mouse position. At this stage, you can not see the line renderer curve.

Change Base Position(Button): After selecting a position for the ground , you need to click on this button to see the line renderer for the projectile motion. Finally, you can throw the ball by clicking on the main ground(red).
